    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/2 inch thickness</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup of pank bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 cup of oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>
            Season the chicken breasts on both sides with
            salt and pepeer. Place the flour, egg and panko
            crumbs into separate shallow dishes. Coat the
            chicken breasts in flour, shacking off any excess.
            Dip them into the egg, and then press into the
            panko crumbs until well coated on both sides.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a large skillet over medium-high
            heat. Place chicken in the hot oil, and cook 3 or 4 minutes
            per side, or until golden brown.
        </li>
    </ol>
